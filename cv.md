## About me  


I want to be a programmer, I am motivated and focused on results. I devote all my free time to studying and get great pleasure from it! At the moment I work as an accountant, this work also requires a lot of time, focus and constant updating of knowledge, so it really interferes with my training=)  
My goal is to change my profession and become the best web developer!
